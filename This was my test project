Aspiring Frontend Engineer dedicated to mastering the modern web stack. My primary focus is on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, building practical tools like my recent multi-calculator project (featuring BMI, Loan, and Unit Conversions). Constantly learning and looking to contribute to open-source. Find me diving into documentation or connecting with the JavaScript community. Let's build something great!
